Objective
Today we will expand our knowledge of strings, combining it with what we have already learned about loops. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

Task
Given a string, 'S', of length 'N' that is indexed from '0' to 'N','-1' print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as '2' space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Example
s=adbecf

Print abc def

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, 'T' (the number of test cases).
Each line 'i' of the 'T' subsequent lines contain a string, 'S'.


Output Format

For each String  (where ), print 's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by 's odd-indexed characters.
